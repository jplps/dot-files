# Dot Files

Files and/or directories with a . prepended to their name are considered "dot-files". The leading dot . is used as an indicator by software like bash and nautilus to not list these files normally but only when they are specifically requested like pressing Ctrl+H in explorers for example. 

Dot-files are used to store configurations for different applications but they are sometimes used otherwise. 

People tend to backup & also share their dot-files so others can boot-strap their own applications using those configuration files.

### .bash_aliases

Global bash (terminal) configurations aliases. Contains aliases, git tools and prompt-export.

### .gitconfig
